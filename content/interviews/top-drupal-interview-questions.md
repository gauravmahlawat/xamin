- **Nodes**: Nodes are individual pieces of content, such as articles, pages, or blog posts, created based on a specific content type.

## 4. What is a Drupal module?

A Drupal module is a collection of files that enhances or extends Drupal's functionality. Modules can add features, alter existing behaviors, and integrate with third-party services.

## 5. How can you extend Drupal's functionality using modules?

You can extend Drupal's functionality using contributed modules from the Drupal community or by creating custom modules. Contributed modules can be downloaded and installed, while custom modules are created to address specific needs.

## 6. What is the purpose of the Drupal theme layer?

The Drupal theme layer controls the presentation and appearance of your Drupal site. It uses templates, stylesheets, and other assets to control how content is rendered.

## 7. How do you create a custom theme in Drupal?

To create a custom theme in Drupal, you need to:

The hook system in Drupal allows modules to interact with and alter the behavior of other modules. Hooks are functions that modules can implement to respond to specific events, such as when content is saved or a page is displayed.

The database abstraction layer in Drupal provides a consistent way to interact with different database systems. It helps ensure compatibility and reduces the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
